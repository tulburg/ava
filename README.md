# AVA (Advance Voice Assistant)
Ava is a state persistent modular multi-intent based behavioural voice assistant built in python.
The aim is to create a Companion AI. Ava aims to become an every day companion, at work, home, office, restaurants etc. By creating a background which will include, pet talks, jokes handling, emotional responses (everyday conversations with any human), with these background in all instance of Ava either at work or home, other modules that provide more functionality for different instance can now be built. Since the best way to fully implement a companion ai is to fully integrate it within an operating system, the aim is to create a community powered AI that is capable of various fits and then embed it in our everyday devices.
### Getting Started
Ava is part of the idea of making artificial intelligence available for all. Ava is community developed application so we are currently looking for contributors to join the community. Ideas and suggestions are always welcomed from non programmers as well.
